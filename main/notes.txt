- he said to look into pivot tables.
- also make pretty plots if you want a higher grade. 

- how that compares to matches where lower rank player lost

a jittler plot for match duration and surface

in the repo make the number of how many matches (rows)


- 1. Player Performance & Ranking
How does player ranking correlate with match wins?
Do higher-ranked players win a significantly larger proportion of matches?

2. Surface & Tournament Analysis
Which surfaces (hard, clay, grass) yield the most upsets?
Compare frequency of lower-ranked players beating higher-ranked ones by surface.

3. Serve & Return Statistics
How do serve stats (aces, double faults, 1st serve %) relate to match outcomes?
Do winners consistently have more aces or higher first serve percentages?
Is there a relationship between break points faced/saved and match result?
Do players who save more break points have higher win rates?


5. Player Style & Nationality
Do players from certain countries (winner_ioc, loser_ioc) excel on specific surfaces?
E.g., are Spanish players more successful on clay?
Are specific surfaces more frequent in different countries? 
Are there more hard surfaces in spain?\


Would want to learn the dataset to understand the answer, how many players, what is the distribution of winners. Just really modest summaries. Few bar plots or histograms


What to ask: How does upset probability change as the rank gap grows? Does a 20‑spot gap differ materially from 100+?
